            Hi, my name is Yanet, and I’m a third-year Computer Science student at Addis Ababa University.
            I’m deeply passionate about technology and problem-solving, and over the past few years I’ve been
            sharpening my skills as a full-stack developer. From working with backend logic to designing smooth,
            user-friendly interfaces, I enjoy building applications that people can actually use and interact with.<br><br>
            I consider myself a very eager learner — I’m always curious to explore new tools, frameworks, and ideas
            in the tech world. Whether it’s experimenting with fresh web development techniques or improving my
            understanding of computer science fundamentals, I’m constantly pushing myself to grow. I believe that
            every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, and I approach each project with the mindset of
            leaving it better than I found it.<br><br>
            Outside of coding, I’m a huge music fan. I love exploring different genres and artists, since music keeps
            me inspired and helps me stay creative. I’m also a football fan, which means I spend my free time following
            matches, enjoying the energy of the game, and connecting with other fans. For me, coding, music, and football
            all share a common thread: passion, creativity, and continuous improvement. That same energy is what motivates
            me to collaborate, solve problems, and keep building meaningful projects that make an impact.
